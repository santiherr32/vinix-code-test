## Technologies
I used `html`, `css`, `sass`, `react`, `typescript`, `javascript`, `bootstrap`, `context-api`

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to start the local development server 
- run `npm build` to set up a production ready build of the project

## Approach
I adopted the `BEM` naming style for my css class names but using sass as the preprocessor on top.
